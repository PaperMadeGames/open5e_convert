## Shard Tabletop Importing
For detailed explanation [see this document](https://www.shardtabletop.com/howto/importing-books-and-content-conversion?rq=convert)

### Quick version:
Once you have created a Docx file then you will need to go to shardtabletop.com and create a new book. When prompted you will want to "Import Book" and then select the docx file you generated with this script. Give your new book a name and click "create".

After that the book will open in editing mode. Click on the section you want to convert (e.g. 'Monsters'). Click the 'hamburger' button next to the section, then choose "Convert Children". Then choose the appropriate thing you are importing. Check that the content looks good and Click the "Keep and Update Book".

You are done. you have successfully imported stuff to shard.

### A note on deleting...
If you find that stuff didn't work you will want to delete all the spells created by the book by going to "my Creations" and searching for everything in the book you created. Then delete all the stuff you imported. AFTER you have deleted the things then you can delete the book and start over. If you delete the book first then you will need to manually delete all the things you imported.
